index.js?b635:10 Hello World
game.js?cdc0:68 game x 500     - >max width of canvas
game.js?cdc0:69 game y 750  -> max hheight of canvas



game.js?cdc0:70 game xSpace 602 --> window width minus canvas width
game.js?cdc0:71 game ySpace 1311 -> window height minus canvas heigth
game.js?cdc0:50 xDim 600   - > width dimesions
game.js?cdc0:51 yDim 756 -> height dimesions
game.js?cdc0:52 xstart 0 -> start of canvas also start of score table
game.js?cdc0:53 ystar 36 -> score table height
game.js?cdc0:54 xend 600 width dimesions the end point
game.js?cdc0:55 yend 756 height dimesions the end point
game.js?cdc0:56 24 -> default size for an object to take part of the screen
with a proper ratio to the canvas
game.js?cdc0:57 24


twoThirds =((Game.DIMY - 0 || scoretable height(36))*2/3)+ 0 ||(36)
sqaurePos = twoThirds - ((twothirds%24)
topLimit =  squarePos + (24/2); -> player Area
